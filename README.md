# Hello Erlang!
These are notes and quotes i take about Erlang while<br>
reading the [Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/) book.

  <summary><strong>numbers</strong></summary>

  both floating point numbers or integers are supported when dealing with arithmetic. Integers and floating values are pretty much the only types of data Erlang's mathematical operators will handle transparently for you. to have the integer-to-integer division, use `div`, and to have the modulo operator, use `rem`.

    5 / 2.
    -> 2.5

    5 div 2
    -> 2

  to express integers in other bases than base 10, just enter the number as Base#Value (given Base is in the range 2..36):

    2#101010.
    -> 42

    8#0677.
    -> 447

    16#AE.
    -> 174

  <summary><strong>invariable variables</strong></summary>

  variable names must begin with a capital letter. you can assign a value to a variable exactly once. you can `pretend` to assign a value to a variable if it's the same value it already has.

    One = 1.
    Two = One + One.
    Two = 2.
    Two = 3.
    -> ** exception error: no match of right hand side value 3

  the `=` operator has the role of comparing values and complaining if they're different. If they're the same, it returns the value.

    47 = 45 + 3.
    -> ** exception error: no match of right hand side value 48

  if the left-hand side term is a variable and it is `unbound` (has no value associated to it), Erlang will automatically bind the right-hand side value to the variable on the left-hand side. The comparison will consequently succeed and the variable will keep the value in memory.

  the `=` operator is the basis of the `pattern matching`

  technically, variables can start with an underscore too, but by convention their use is restricted to values you do not care about, yet you felt it was necessary to document what it contains.

  <summary><strong>atoms</strong></summary>

  atoms are literals, constants with their own name for value. an atom should be enclosed in single quotes (') if it does not begin with a lower-case letter or if it contains other characters than alphanumeric characters, underscore or @.

    atom.
    atoms_rule@erlang.
    'Atoms can be cheated!'.

  an atom with single quotes is exactly the same as a similar atom without them

    atom = 'atom'.
    -> atom

  an atom is referred to in an `atom table` which consumes memory. atom table is not garbage collected, and so atoms will accumulate until the system tips over, either from **memory usage** or because **1048577** atoms were declared. this means atoms should not be generated dynamically for whatever reason.

  some atoms are reserved words: `after`, `and`, `andalso`, `band`, `begin`, `bnot`, `bor`, `bsl`, `bsr`, `bxor`, `case`, `catch`, `cond`, `div`, `end`, `fun`, `if`, `let`, `not`, `of`, `or`, `orelse`, `query`, `receive`, `rem`, `try`, `when`, `xor`

  <summary><strong>boolean algebra</strong></summary>

  there is not much to say

    true and false.
    -> false

    false or true.
    -> true

    true xor false.
    -> true

    not false.
    -> true

    not (true and true).
    -> false

  the boolean operators `and` and `or` will always evaluate arguments on both sides of the operator. If you want to have the short-circuit operators (which will only evaluate the right-side argument if it needs to), use `andalso` and `orelse`.

  erlang has no such things as boolean `true` and `false`. **the terms true and false are atoms**, *but they are integrated well enough into the language you shouldn't have a problem with that as long as you don't expect false and true to mean anything but false and true.*

  <summary><strong>comparison operators</strong></summary>

  - `=:=` exactly equal
  - `=/=` exactly not equal
  - `==` equal
  - `/=` not equal
  - `<` less than
  - `>` greather than
  - `>=` greater than or equal to
  - `=<` less than or equal to

```
5 =:= 5.
-> true

1 =:= 0.
-> false

1 =/= 0.
-> true

5 =:= 5.0.
-> false

5 =:= true.
-> false

5 == 5.0.
-> true

5 /= 5.0.
-> false

1 < 2.
-> true

1 < 1.
-> false

1 >= 1.
-> true

1 =< 1.
-> true

5 + llama.
-> ** exception error: bad argument in an arithmetic expression
```

the correct ordering of each element in a comparison is the following: <br>
`number` **<** `atom` **<** `reference` **<** `fun` **<** `port` **<** `pid` **<** `tuple` **<** `list` **<** `bit string`

this is why you can compare anything with anything.
```
0 == false.
-> false

1 < false.
-> true
```

  <summary><strong>tuples</strong></summary>
  A tuple is a way to organize data.

    Point = {3,5}.

    {X,Y} = Point.
    X.
    -> 3
    Y.
    -> 5

    {_,Y2} = Point.
    Y2.
    -> 5

  `_` is the anonymous variable. this is exactly how it's meant to be used: to drop the value that would usually be placed there since we won't use it. The `_` variable is always seen as unbound and acts as a wildcard for pattern matching.

  pattern matching to unpack tuples will only work if the number of elements (the tuple's length) is the same.

    {_,_} = {4,5,6}.
    -> ** exception error: no match of right hand side value {4,5,6}

  tuples can also be useful when working with single values.

    PreciseTemperature = {celsius, 23.213}.
    {kelvin, T} = PreciseTemperature.
    -> ** exception error: no match of right hand side value {celsius,23.213}

  a tuple which contains an atom with one element following it is called a `tagged tuple`.

    {point, {X,Y}}.

  <summary><strong>lists</strong></summary>

  lists can contain anything and you can mix more than one type of data in it.

    [1, 2, 3, {numbers,[4,5,6]}, 5.34, atom].

  strings are lists and the notation is absolutely the exact same

    [97, 98, 99].
    -> "abc"

  erlang will print lists of numbers as numbers only when at least one of them could not also represent a letter

    [97,98,99,4,5,6].
    -> [97,98,99,4,5,6]

    [233].
    -> "Ã©"

  there is no such thing as a real string in erlang

  glue lists together

    [1,2,3] ++ [4,5].
    -> [1,2,3,4,5]

  remove elements from a list

    [1,2,3,4,5] -- [1,2,3].
    -> [4,5]

    [2,4,2] -- [2,4].
    -> [2]

    [2,4,2] -- [2,4,2].
    -> []

    [2,3,4,5] -- [3,4].
    -> [2,5]

    [2,3,4,5] -- [3,5].
    -> [2,4]

  both `++` and `--` are right-associative

    [1,2,3] -- [1,2] -- [3].
    -> [3]

    [1,2,3] -- [1,2] -- [2].
    -> [2,3]

  get length

    length([1,2,3,4]).
    -> 4

  get head

    hd([1,2,3,4]).
    -> 1

  get tail

    tl([1,2,3,4]).
    -> [2,3,4]

  or use pattern matching

    [Head|Tail] = [1,2,3,4].

    Head.
    -> 1

    Tail.
    -> [2,3,4]

  add head

    List = [2,3,4].
    NewList = [1|List].
    -> [1,2,3,4]

  `|` is named the `cons operator` (constructor),  any list can be built with only cons and values

    [3 | [2 | [1 | []] ] ].
    -> [3,2,1]

  note: using the form `[1 | 2]` gives what we call an `improper list`. improper lists will work when you pattern match in the `[Head|Tail]` manner, but will fail to be used with standard functions of erlang (even `length()`). this is because erlang expects `proper lists`. proper lists **end with an empty list** as their last cell. when declaring an item like `[2]`, the list is automatically formed in a proper manner. as such, `[1|[2]]` would work! improper lists, although syntactically valid, are of very limited use outside of user-defined data structures.

  <summary><strong>referential transparency</strong></summary>

  an expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior. This requires that the expression be pure, that is to say the expression value must be the same for the same inputs and its evaluation must have no side effects. An expression that is not referentially transparent is called referentially opaque.
